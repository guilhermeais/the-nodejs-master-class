# the-nodejs-master-class
An application made in pure Node JS, without any libraries ðŸ˜³
<hr/>
<h3>
  The main goal of this project is to obvisiously improve my NodeJS abilities, but, too improve my english understanding
</h3>
<b/>
This may sound unproductive (and is indeed), but I'm really enjoying it, because in it i'm learning:
<ul>
  <li>
    About the built-in NodeJS modules
  </li>
  <li>
    Increasing my understanding about how the things works under the table, like, i usually use frameworks or third-party libraries like EXPRESS or AdonisJS to create api's, but here, i'm
    using built-in modules of NodeJs instead, like http/https 
  </li>
</ul>
